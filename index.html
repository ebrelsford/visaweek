            <h2>week 1: bar charts</h2>
            <p>This week I'm starting by looking at the change in rent stabilized units in NYC in relation to Google's <a href="http://www.citylab.com/design/2016/08/google-maps-areas-of-interest/493670/">areas of interest</a>. Has an area marked as an "area of interest" by the most widely used mapping provider experienced more of a loss in rent stabilized units than outside of these areas?</p>
            <p>I started by tracing Google's "areas of interest" in NYC with <a href="http://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>. Once I had polygons for each area of interest I made a quarter-mile buffer around the areas to represent a very short walking distance. I then segmented the change in rent stabilized units data&mdash;if the change in units was within the buffer it went into one segment, outside the buffer into another segment. Finally, I aggregated the counts of these units by segment and neighborhood tabulation area (NTA), a rough proxy for neighborhood boundaries in NYC that can be used with census data.</p>
            <p><a href="week1-barcharts/e/">The results</a> do seem to imply that the areas that have been marked as areas of interest previously (2007 to 2014) lost more rent stabilized units than the rest of a neighborhood. It seems likely that that places that attract people and that Google recognizes as attracting people are also the kinds of places where landlords and other speculators would try to remove rent stabilized units and charge market rates.</p>
            <p>Data sources:
                <ul>
                    <li>Google maps</li>

            <h2>week 2: line charts</h2>
            <p>This week kept things a bit simpler. I made a line chart of the number of 311 service requests made in New York by month, back to 2011.</p>
            <p>Data sources:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-by-month/89wm-wt98/data">NYC Open Data</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Here are the results:

                    <li><a href="week2-linecharts/a/">first draft</a></li>

            <h2>week 3: force-directed graphs</h2>
            <p>This week I'm using Buzzfeed's <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld?utm_term=.sr5bKXB5VN#.ljN7OX6nR8">TrumpWorld</a> data to make force-directed graphs. The following are some attempts at using force-directed graphs to show the relationships between organizations listed in the data. Future iterations should look more at relationships between organizations, add people, and some way to filter data (eg by name or only showing certain relationships).</p>
            <p>Data sources:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld?utm_term=.sr5bKXB5VN#.ljN7OX6nR8">Buzzfeed's TrumpWorld</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Here are the results:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="week3-graphs/a/">first draft</a></li>

            <h2>week 4: force-directed graphs again</h2>
            <p>This week I'm using Buzzfeed's <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld?utm_term=.sr5bKXB5VN#.ljN7OX6nR8">TrumpWorld</a> data again to improve the force-directed graphs from last time. Specifically, I added more data (previously the graphs only showed organizations), and I've improved the interactivity with the links between nodes.</p>
            <p>Data sources:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld?utm_term=.sr5bKXB5VN#.ljN7OX6nR8">Buzzfeed's TrumpWorld</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Here are the results:

                    <li><a href="week4-graphs/a/">added people</a></li>

            <h2>week 5: a map</h2>
            <p>This week I'm going back to week 1's data: Google's areas of interest. I'm simply overlaying the areas of interest on top of the borough boundaries.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Google Maps, as described in week 1.</li>
